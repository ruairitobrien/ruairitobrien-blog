*I started having very vivid dreams at one point. I decided to start writing them down as soon as I woke up before they slipped away. This one was from August 6th, 2017 in Stockholm.*

Very heavy night of dreams this night. Most of them forgotten. 

There was one where I was with a group of friends from many years ago. Can't remember what was happening, only the feeling of what it was like to be around them all again.

One dream was about me apparently doing something bad. I appeared to have a large stash of weapons and cash and something was coming to a head. I had a strong impending sense of doom. I recall bragging about all the ill gotten stuff I had. All my stuff was held in fairly silly hidden compartments in a large room. The compartments could be opened by doing things such as moving a book in a bookshelf or stepping on a particular tile. Despite the bragging, I felt very concerned about something but I couldn't figure out what.  

Then there were two, black widow like, poisonous spiders and it appears they were somehow my children.

Unsure why or with who but there was a large battle. People were fighting and dying everywhere. I was involved. I got wounded.

When the battle ended I was surrounded by people I knew. I was in pain and dying from my wounds. My spider children came to me. I had seen them bite and kill others. I asked them to bite me. Apparently what would be a painless death to end my suffering. I had an almost overwhelming sense of love and affection for them as they bit me. Then I woke up.
