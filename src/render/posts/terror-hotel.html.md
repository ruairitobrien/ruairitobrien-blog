*I started having very vivid dreams at one point. I decided to start writing them down as soon as I woke up before they slipped away. This one was from August 4th, 2017 in Stockholm.*

I was in a hotel. Not fully sure with who but I know my partner and son were there. 

It was a weird and complex hotel. Incredibly difficult to explain. Many levels, winding stairs. Doors that looked like exits but only lead to other halls. 

There was a terrorist attack. Well, the only indication of an attack was a man shouting in what sounded to me like arabic. I don't recall any other indication but somehow concluded we were in the middle of a terrorist attack and we all started running in fear. 

The escape was chaotic. I found myself running through fake exits, all the whie trying to make sure everyone with me was ok. Eventually we escaped the hotel  and took refuge in what seems to have been a house.

Once in the house, my son went to the kitchen with another child (not sure who the child was but possibly my niece). I waited by the front door, I think keeping watch for terrorists.

Suddenly the house started to kind of, tip over. I lost my footing and began falling towards the back wall. I was consumed with fear about what was happening to my son in the kitchen. I tried desperately to get to him but movement was weirdly awkward and I couldn't make progress. That strange dream sensation where you lose all physical power. Then I woke up.
