*I started having very vivid dreams at one point. I decided to start writing them down as soon as I woke up before they slipped away. This one was from August 8th, 2017 in Stockholm.*

I am in a park with my laptop. I call someone to meet me in a nearby church. Then it seems I call someone else to meet me at the same time. For some reason this is a mistake. These people should not meet each other.

I go to the church for the meeting, only to realize I am not dressed. I have some kind of rags on. Then I see one of the people I am supposed to meet later at the church but do not talk to them. I run away to find some clothes. 

I run back to the park bench where I left my laptop and some clothes. I feel a moment of panic worrying that someone might have stolen my laptop but when I get back everything is just as I left it. 

I open my laptop and begin doing something. After a while I realize I have forgotten to meet the people. I begin to dress myself quickly and clumsily. Then one of the people I am supposed to meet shows up at the bench. I splutter out some aplogies as I still try to dress myself. They laugh and seem to be fine about it. 

Meanwhile I keep worrying about the other person in the church. I struggle to recall who they are or why I can't show up with the person I am currently with (whoever they are). I feel a deep guilt and concern that I have left them waiting for me. Then I wake up.
