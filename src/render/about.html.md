My name is Ruair√≠ O'Brien.

I work as a programmer and love it.

This blog is all about things I enjoy learning.

While I mostly do this blog for myself I hope that, as I have enjoyed and been helped by so many blogs since I started programming, my blog might one day be enjoyed by or help someone else.
